Code Overview

This Flutter app creates a simple profile card interface. It displays a profile picture, name, occupation, phone number, and email address, all styled with Material Design components.

MaterialApp: The root widget that applies Material Design styles.

Scaffold: Provides the structure, including background color and layout.

CircleAvatar: Displays a circular profile picture.

Text Widgets: Show the name and occupation with custom fonts and colors.
Card and ListTile Widgets: Display contact details like phone number and email with icons.

The app uses the Column widget to align all components in the center, and the SafeArea ensures the layout is responsive and avoids screen notches.
